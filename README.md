# the progs & cons of vue


there are some of my view:  

1.vue is an open-source javascript framework for building user interfaces.  

2.by using it, we can quickly build a user interfaces. a little like the tkinter in python 2.7. but its features is more powerful than tkinter.  

3.vue claim that it is easy to learn. for me, after I saw some code using vue, I found it readable indeed. but as my poor knowledge about javascript, I couldn't tell if it is easy.  

4.some advantages:lowcost to use; flexible to use(having complete ecology system, supporting almost any type of tools); effective(small in size, good optimization, performance excellent)

5.
