# the progs & cons of vue


there are some of my view:  

1.vue is an open-source javascript framework for building user interfaces.  

2.by using it, we can quickly build a user interfaces. a little like the tkinter in python 2.7. but its features is more powerful than tkinter.  

3.this framework can help javascript make great works.
