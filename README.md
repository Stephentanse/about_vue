# the progs & cons of vue


there are some of my view:  

1.vue is an open-source javascript framework for building user interfaces.  

2.by using it, we can quickly build a user interfaces. a little like the tkinter in python 2.7. but its features is more powerful than tkinter.  

3.vue claim that it is easy to learn. for me, after I saw some code using vue, I found it readable indeed. but as my poor knowledge about javascript, I couldn't tell if it is easy.  

4.some advantages:lowcost to use; flexible to use(having complete ecology system, supporting almost any type of tools); effective(small in size, good optimization, performance excellent)

5.vue use bothway data binding. so user's input can be immediately reflect without submit webpage.

6.I found some disadvantages about it. such as  it can't support IE8, and its framework maybe a little complicated than other progranmming language. 

7.I think I need better learning abput javascript,css and html so I can learn it deeper.
